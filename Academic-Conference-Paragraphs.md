## Paragraphoi and paragraphs in three manuscripts of the *Iliad*

Liam Prendergast '19 and Steven Paganelli '19


---

## Why Paragraphs?


- connection between presentation of the text and content
- where do they appear?
- no one has looked at these; what can they tell us?

---

## Three manuscripts



- Venetus A (Venice, 10th c.)
- Venetus B (Venice, 11th c.)
- Upsilon 1.1 (Escorial monastery, 11th c.)

## *Paragraphoi* in the Venetus A

- etymology: Παρα + γράφω meaing "write alongside"
- a *Paragraphos* is a horizontal mark above (and next to) the first word in a line.
- only Appear in the Venetus A.
- used to break up section of the text.

## "Edents" in Venetus B and Upsilon 1.1

- Upsilon 1.1 and Venetus B are considered "twin" texts
- edents are lines that have been shifted into the left margin.

## The Research

- looked at Venetus A
- made a note of each occurrence of a Paragraphos
- recorded the book number and line number
- edents in Upsilon 1.1 and Venetus B were recorded in the summer by Corey Scannell and Michael Kelley

---

## Processing the data

- limited the range to books 2 through 7
- included line that are off by 1 or 2

## Agreement across all three manuscripts

Out of **521** distinct paragraph breaks:

| Agreement | Number of lines |
|:----------|:----------------|
| 3 MSS     | 120             |
| 2 MSS     | 246             |
| 1 MS      | 155             |





---

## Unique content by manuscript

| MS          | Unique breaks | Total breaks |
|:------------|:--------------|:-------------|
| Venetus A   | 66            | 270          |
| Venetus B   | 21            | 318          |
| Upsilon 1.1 | 68            | 419          |

## Comparing Edents in Venetus B and Upsilon 1.1

 Books 2 through 7:

- they share 282 Edents
    - 89% of Venetus B
    - 67% of Upsilon 1.1
- Venetus B has 101 less Edents then Upsilon 1.1

---


## Implications

- organization in paragraphs is choice of scribe
- Venetus A clearly different from other 2 MSS
- Venetus B is nearly a subset of Upsilon 1.1:
    - common source
    - scribe of Upsilon 1.1 adds Paragraphs

---


## Questions

Paragraphs are a form of "markup" indicating change of:

- speaker
- scene
- voice (simile)

Are these distinctions also found in the scholia?

---


## Future work

- taxonomy of paragraph breaks
- extend coverage across all 24 books

---

## Thank you!
