## Pairings of signs

Out of 134 critical scholia:


| Pairing                                                  | Number |
|:---------------------------------------------------------|:-------|
| Sign on Scholion matches with sign on the line           | 87     |
| Sign on the line, but no sign on the Scholion            | 16     |
| Sign on the Scholion different from the sign on the line | 27     |


---

##Class 1: signs on scholion and line  match##

- Most signs are diples
- No asterisks
- Nothing unusual about the type of comments in Class 1
- Duplication to aid navigation on page?

---

##Class 2:  Mark on scholion, none on line

- Infrequent
- Provisional Hypothesis: Signs on the Iliad line were lost over the course of the transmission

---

##Class 3: Sign on the Scholion different from the sign on the line##

- Predominantly occurs with obeloi and asteriskoi
- 2-3 confuse dotted diple and diple
- so, **editorial discussion**


---

## Secondary function of the asterisk

- Customary placement of scholia (Churik's Law)
- A navigational mechanism for out-of-place scholia

## Conclusions


- need to check Dindorf against photography
- Class 1: are there regularly navigational explanations for repeating signs?
- Class 2: suggests transmission is "lossy"
- Class 3: did signs drop from *Iliad* in debated passages?
