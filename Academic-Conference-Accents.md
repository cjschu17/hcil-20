## From musical pitch to grammatical rule: accent in Homeric manuscripts

## Positioning of Diacritics
- The accents tend to appear to the right of center over a character.
- Our "standard" system of accentuation places diacritics on the second letter of a dipthong. The Venetus A shows no such consistency.

## Diereses
- Diereses typically fall over the second letter of a dipthong and signify that the dipthong should be pronounced as two syallables. The Venetus A makes use of the dieresis to this end.
- However, in the Venetus A, a dieresis (or a mark shaped like a dieresis) can also fall over word-initial iotas.
- Other diacritics on iotas with diereses lack consistency. For example, a fourth of the occurences of unaccented iotas with diereses lacks a breathing mark.

## "Floating Graves"

- Throughout the Venetus A, there are approximately 230 occurences of grave accents that appear in the space where an elided letter would be.
- It could possibly be an attempt on the part of the scholiast to make word divisions clear.
- It could also be the scholiast's attempt to satisfy contradictory grammar rules.

## Enclitics
- The Venetus A scribe treats enclitic accent rules differently.
