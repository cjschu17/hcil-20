## Positioning of Diacritics
- The accents tend to appear to the right of center over a character.
- Our "standard" system of accentuation assumes that breathing marks and accents appear on the second letter of a dipthong. The Venetus A shows no such consistency.

## Diereses
- Diereses typically fall over one letter of a dipthong and signify that the dipthong should be pronounced as two syallables.
- In the Venetus A, diereses (or a similarly shaped mark) can fall over initial iotas.
- Other diacritics on iotas with diereses lack consistency.There are 250 instances of an initial iotas with diereses that lack a breathing mark. A fourth of the occurences of unaccented iotas with diereses lack a breathing mark.

-It could also be the scholiasts attempt to satisfy grammar rules.
